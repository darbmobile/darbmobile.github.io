# Alternative Movie Posters

These are usually created using images from the brilliant [Movie Stills Database](https://www.moviestillsdb.com). It's an awesome resource for high resolution, film related images.

I also commonly use [Open Foundry](https://open-foundry.com) for typefaces. They really know how to present typefaces in a way that inspires instead of just creating decision fatigue like say, Google Fonts.
