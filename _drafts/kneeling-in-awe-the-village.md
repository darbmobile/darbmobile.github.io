I've been wanting write something about [The Village][1] for a while. 

My immense adoration for the film and the general consensus that it was a failure seems to keep the film on my mind more than any everyday masterpiece.[^1]

<p class="message">Note: This article will 100%, without-a-doubt, definitely spoil the film. Please watch The Village before reading, it’s pretty great.</p>

I didn't see the film in theatres. _The.Village.2004.DVD.DivX.HQ.ENiGMA.avi_ was likely watched on an evening after school, squashed blearily between screenings of other films I had found on some top-10 "best films you've never heard of" list. 

Going into this film I knew who M. Night Shyamalan was. The Sixth Sense was spoiled for me by a Scrubs episode[^2] and Shyamalan's twists had become a meme long ago.

The director continues his legacy of illusion here. Sorrow diluted by mysticism is everywhere. None of the adults seem particularly content and the young people are seemingly cursed by disability and impediment[^3]. However The Village™ is to me, at least initially, a lovely place to live. That’s the real trick M. Night is pulling here; he creates a place so enticing, beautiful and comforting that when he begins to knock it down, it is felt. For some I’m sure, this demolition of such an idyllic, fairytale place into the cynicism of reality can cause a bit of anger toward the film.

The main plot concerns residents of an unnamed village, living in relative harmony but all the while fearing “those we do not speak of”; monsters in the surrounding woods. Lucius played by Joaquin Phoenix[^4] is an introverted, yet precocious young man who, is set on travelling to “the towns”(an oft cited corrupt, region beyond the woods which surround the village). This small crack in the otherwise “perfect” life of the village dwellers is what sets the plot in motion and also provides a small glimpse into the real story of this place, a story of congenital disfunction and the triumph of the young over it.

## Love and trust
Early on we meet the Ivy Walker and her friend (and often times ward) Noah Percy, they have a clear bond over their disabilities: blindness and intellectual impairment. 

Lucius is forbidden to leave and in the ensuing weeks is convinced further to fear the journey through the woods. This culminates in a night time raid of the town by “those we do not speak of”, their spikes and read cloaks float over the village in eerie slowness and then all at once, frightening speed. Then comes the scene which I believe provides the thesis of the entire film.

As the raid happens, Ivy, Noah, and her family are scrambling to hide in their cellar, yet Ivy is waiting in the doorway, hand outstretched, waiting for Lucius to find her.

To explain this, we have to spoil the multiple twists the film offers.

1. “Those we do not speak of” are not monsters, but the town elders in costumes.
2. The Village™ elders are manipulating the townspeople to keep them from leaving…
3. because it is actually the modern day and…
4. the elders suffered horrible trauma at the hands of crime in their previous, modern lives and have created The Village™ in an attempt to escape their grief

I challenge anyone to resist chills when that [wonderful music by James Newton Howard][2] kicks in and Lucius takes Ivy to the cellar. The film is worth watching if only for this scene.

[^1]:	For example, the brilliant but terribly overrated Parasite.

[^2]:	The one where Janitor and Dr. Cox are spoiling things for each other. From my understanding, I am not the sole victim claimed by this episode.

[^3]:	The primary characters we follow are all afflicted in one way or another. Ivy is blind, Noah has an intellectual disability and Lucius is emotionally constipated, even moreso than the elders of the town.

[^4]:	One of his best roles. His subtlety as Lucius seems to have left him in recent years.
